# ML_Algorithms_from_Scratch
These are the implementations of various algorithms. Mostly the algorithms are in python, but I have coded some of them in Matlab, just to get a different programming view to the problem. There are several algorithms I have implemented successfully, most of which were Theory -> Code,  Like the Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, NN, Decision Trees of 2 digit classification etc...
